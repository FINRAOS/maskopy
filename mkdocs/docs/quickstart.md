# Quick Start

This quick start will help us get started with build, deployment and execution of Maskopy Step Function. 
The Step Function executes a series of lambda functions and runs a fargate task to obfuscate data.

## Pre-requisites
This section lists the tools for local setup and AWS resources that are needed for Maskopy to run.
### Local Environment
Need below tools in the local to build lambda functions, connect to AWS accounts and build  docker container for obfuscation.

1. python3, pip, zip
2. aws cli
3. docker
### AWS Environment
Maskopy requires a minimum of two AWS accounts.

1. Source Account : This account hosts the RDS instance within a vpc and subnet which needs to be masked and copied to other accounts. 
Take a note of vpc-id and subnet-ids. These will be required to provide as inputs when creating resources in this AWS account.
**IAM Roles** : Follow the steps documented in [Setup in Source account](iam-roles.md#source-account) and create IAM roles in source account.

  
2. Staging Account : This account is where the lambdas and step function are deployed and executed from. 
The final snapshot gets created in this account. This account needs to have a vpc, public and private subnets, route tables for internet access and s3 bucket to stage lambda code. 
Just like from the source account, take a note of AWS 12-digit account number, vpc-id, subnet-ids and s3 bucket name. These will be needed to provide as input to create resources in the AWS account.
**IAM Roles** : Follow the steps documented in [Setup in Staging account](iam-roles.md#staging-account) and create IAM roles in staging account.

Current version of Maskopy treats the staging account as destination account where the final snapshot is copied.
Future versions will be able to obfuscate once in the staging account and copy to multiple destination accounts.  

## Create Resources in AWS

After all the above pre-requisites are completed, we will create the following resources in source and staging AWS accounts.

- KMS Keys
- Security groups
- ECR
- SQS Queue
- Deploy Maskopy Lambda and Step functions

Follow the steps in [AWS Setup](aws-setup.md) to create these resources.


## Execution
After the AWS setup is completed, Maskopy Step function is ready to be executed which will obfuscate data and copy the snapshot.

### Step 1 : Export AWS credentials
Export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY from staging account and run in a terminal.

Note:  If you are using an IAM user to run this setup, then you need to do the following:

1. Add trust relationship from your IAM user to the Maskopy Execution role.
2. Run assumeRole to assume the role of the Maskopy Execution role by running below.
```
STS_OUTPUT=$(aws sts assume-role --role-arn ${EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN} --role-session-name Maskopy --output text | sed -n '2 p')
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(echo "${STS_OUTPUT}" | cut -f2)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(echo "${STS_OUTPUT}" | cut -f4)
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(echo "${STS_OUTPUT}" | cut -f5)
export AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN=$(echo "${STS_OUTPUT}" | cut -f5)
```

### Step 2 : Provide Input
Input to Maskopy is provided through environment variables. Below are the list of input that is required to run Maskopy. Refer to the description and examples of all the variables in the table below.

```
./maskopy.sh
```
